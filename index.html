            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi there! I’m Cam, a student at Northeastern University pursuing a combined degree in Cybersecurity and Criminal Justice. I recently completed an internship as an IT User Support Assistant at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. I grew up in Saugus, MA, making me a die hard Boston sports fan! I have a background in graphic design and enjoy lacrosse, skiing, and exploring nature. I’m particularly passionate about systems security and learning new technology. My dual focus on cybersecurity and criminal justice reflects my commitment to understanding both the technical and legal aspects of protecting information and ensuring justice. I’m excited to blend these fields to tackle complex challenges and drive positive change in the digital and legal arenas.</p>
